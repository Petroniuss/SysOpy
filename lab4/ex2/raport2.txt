Observations:
    - Ignoring signals is inherited.
      Forked process and exec both ignore sent signal, 
      so they do not terminate when signal is sent.

    - When handler is installed using sigaction,
      Forked process has the same handler as his parrent 
      Exec does not appear to have any handler installed so 
      he terminates upon receiving signal.
    
    - Masks are inherited. Both forked process 
      and exec block sent signal, so they do not terminate 
      on receiving signal.
    
    - Checking pending singals proceeds as follows:
        Parent masks signal, then it sends one and checks if
        it sees this signal. Children are spawned and we check 
        if pending signals are being copied - which they are not.
      Children do not see parent's pending signals.
